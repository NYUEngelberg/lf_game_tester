<h1 class="header-style">Bonus Fact</h1>

The Library Bill of Rights was created by the Des Moines Public Library Director, Forrest Spaulding (pictured above), in 1938.

According to the Iowa City Public Library, "Spaulding was pressured to censor items in the Des Moines Public Library (DMPL) collection. His response was a Library Bill of Rights presented to the DMPL Board of Trustees."

<img src="images/Censored.png"  alt="Censored stamp">

<h1 class="header-style">Bonus Fact</h1>

The Library Bill of Rights was adopted by the <a href="https://www.ala.org/tools/first-library-bill-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Library Association (ALA)</a> in June of 1939. It was accompanied by a preamble that read, in part: 

“Today indications in many parts of the world point to growing intolerance, suppression of free speech, and censorship affecting the rights of minorities and individuals. Mindful of this, the Council of the American Library Association publicly affirms its belief in the following basic policies.”

<img src="images/BoxingGloves.png" alt="Boxing gloves">

<h1 class="header-style">Bonus Fact</h1>

Article Three mandates that libraries actively fight censorship. It speaks to the importance of resisting book bans but is also pertinent to subtler forms of suppression, such as self-censorship by libraries. 

A 2025 report by Library Futures entitled <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/publications/neo-censorship-in-u-s-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neo-Censorship in U.S. Libraries: An Investigation Into Digital Content Suppression</a> revealed that increased content bans and the threat of worrisome legislation have a chilling effect on libraries, with librarians reporting “self-censorship” even when content hasn’t been challenged. 

Article Three tells libraries that these forms of soft censorship, too, must be resisted.

<img src="images/BusLibrary.png" alt="Schoolbus outside of a school">

<h1 class="header-style">Bonus Fact</h1>

Debates over "age-appropriate" restrictions have been ongoing in school libraries, where librarians are often pressured to limit access to books. Article Four mandates that school librarians protect students’ right to access diverse materials. Restricting books for all students based on personal objections violates this article.

The  <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/accessresources"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Library Association (ALA)</a> writes, "School library policies should remove any barriers and support free and open access to information. School librarians recognize that every parent reserves the right to guide what their learner reads and to select instructional resources that support their family’s unique set of views and opinions but this right to exercise control extends only to their own learner."

<img src="images/EJJosey.png" alt="Portrait of EJ Josey">

<h1 class="header-style">Bonus Fact</h1>

Article Five was added as an amendment to the Library Bill of Rights in 1961.

At this time, Southern libraries barred Black patrons or provided separate and unequal facilities. According to American Libraries Magazine, "Public libraries became an early flashpoint for desegregation ... the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville_Eight
" target="new"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenville (S.C.) Eight</a> in 1960, the   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tougaloo_Nine" target="new"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Tougaloo Nine</a> at the Jackson (Miss.) Public Library in 1961, the <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/st-helena-four-library-sit-in/
" target="new"  rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Helena Four</a> in Greensburg, Louisiana, in 1964, as well as other sit-ins and protests ... led to the desegregation of libraries in the South." 

The American Library Association (ALA) did not address segregation directly until activists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Josey" target="new"  rel="noopener noreferrer">E.J. Josey</a> (a Black librarian) pushed for change. Many libraries initially refused to honor Article Five but it became a tool for those advocating for reform. Article Five also set the stage for later amendments to the Library Bill of Rights, such as the 1967 inclusion of race as a protected category and the 2019 privacy amendment.

In 2019, the American Library Association (ALA) wrote <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/meetingrooms" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interpretation</a> of Article Six of the Library Bill of Rights. It states:

"Libraries do not advocate for or endorse the viewpoints expressed in meetings by meeting room users, just as they do not endorse the viewpoints of works in their collections ... Libraries should adopt and enforce user behavior policies that protect library users and staff from harassment while maintaining their historic support for the freedom of speech."

<img src="images/LockKey.png" alt="Lock and key">

<h1 class="header-style">Bonus Fact</h1>

Article Seven, which addresses the privacy rights of library users, is the most recent revision to the The Library Bill of Rights. 

Article Seven was added in 2019 in response to increasing digital surveillance, data collection, and threats to library user confidentiality. Government and corporate data collection led library users to grow concerned about the privacy of their personal information. With the rise of digital lending, online databases, and electronic tracking, it was necessary for libraries to reaffirm that privacy protections apply to both digital and physical materials. 

Without privacy rights, library users are likely to self-censor due to fears of surveillance. Article Seven reinforces that privacy is essential to the protection of intellectual freedom within library environments.

Library workers currently face an unprecedented volume of threats to intellectual freedom. 

In recent years, conservative calls to restrict collections have resulted in a signficant rise in book bans and censorship of materials.

:: Dilemma - Active Listening {"position":"4250,2850","size":"100,100"}
<img class="fit-picture" src="images/ActiveListening.png" width="300" height="350" alt="alt">

When actively listening to Dr. Yuss, it’s important to focus on the intent and purpose of the conversation. Pay attention to body language and give encouraging verbal cues. You may also ask questions or encourage them to clarify and paraphrase what they're sharing.

It's important to refrain from judgment when listening. Then, summarize, share, and reflect on the information Dr. Yuss just told you. Here is how you might start that interaction:

<span class="speech-style">You:</span> I’m sorry, Dr. Yuss, I couldn’t hear because I was speaking to another patron. Would you please repeat what you were saying? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.



:: Dilemma - Appreciative Curiosity {"position":"4375,2975","size":"100,100"}
<img class="fit-picture" src="images/AppreciativeCuriosity.png" width="300" height="350" alt="alt">

Practicing appreciative curiosity acknowledges library patron concerns and appreciates the time they are spending to provide feedback. 

Keep an eye on your tone and body language. When applied gently and calmly, appreciative curiosity can de-escalate conversation. It allows both parties to retain control and disarm anger. It honors the First Amendment and professional values.

However, it's not always as easy as it seems. Properly applying it takes time, often out of a busy day. It is a skill that takes practice.

To practice appreciative curiosity: here are some questions you can ask Dr. Yuss:

<span class="speech-style">You:</span> So I can fully understand, would you mind sharing more about your concerns with me?

<span class="move-style">or</span>

<span class="speech-style">You:</span> Are there other resources in the library that have better matched your expectations and needs?

Library collection development is the process of systematically building the collection of a particular library to meet the information needs of the library users (a service population) in a timely and economical manner, using information resources locally held as well as resources from other organizations. 

A library's collection development team collaborates with library staff to manage collection budgets and recommend new titles to acquire. They may review reporting regarding national and local trends in order to do so.

Library collection development is the process of systematically building the collection of a particular library to meet the information needs of the library users (a service population) in a timely and economical manner, using information resources locally held as well as resources from other organizations. A library's collection development team collaborates with library staff to manage collection budgets and recommend new titles to aquire. They may review reporting regarding national and local trends in order to do so.

<h1 class="header-style">About Library Policies</h1>

Library policies are written documents that dictate how library staff are expected to respond in various situations they may encounter. Formal policies are critical for assisting in situations such as book challenges, as they provide official guidance on processes for resolution.

Library policies typically incorporate local, state, and/or federal laws. It may be useful to conduct additional research into these laws as there are sometimes creative ways to apply them to library activities. A recent zine from Library Futures entitled <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/post/fight-for-your-right-to-digitize-with-new-zine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Rights: Radical Digital Lending for Libraries</a> details new ways to think about library lending and civil rights.

You may want to check your watch (imaginary watches work too!), say "just one more thing" to indicate the discussion is ending, cross your arms, and use closed body language.

According to the ALA, "The most common justifications for censorship provided by complainants were false claims of illegal obscenity for minors; inclusion of LGBTQIA+ characters or themes; and covering topics of race, racism, equity, and social justice."

A 2025 report by Library Futures entitled <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/publications/neo-censorship-in-u-s-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neo-Censorship in U.S. Libraries: An Investigation Into Digital Content Suppression</a>, demonstrates that many challenges against so-called "inappropriate" or "pornographic" materials within libraries are "purposeful acts of disinformation presented with false narratives about the source, context, or character of the information."

The report also details how these claims can be harmful to minors, given that they are frequently "based on discriminatory ideologies that can negatively impact children’s learning, civil rights, and wellbeing."

<h1 class="header-style">About Local Laws</h1>

It is wise to familiarize yourself with the local laws governing your library as different states and counties may have specific laws pertaining to disorderly conduct, harrassment, public filming, and/or how many parties must consent to being recorded. 

Researching local laws is also useful as there may be creative ways to apply these laws to digital lending and other library activities. A recent zine from Library Futures entitled <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/post/fight-for-your-right-to-digitize-with-new-zine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Rights: Radical Digital Lending for Libraries</a> details new ways to think about library lending and civil rights.

Lastly, keep in mind that <a href="https://bookriot.com/librarian-criminalization-bills-are-growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librarian criminalization bills</a> are on the rise. It is important to stay up to date on local laws reguarding this issue.

Library collection development is the process of systematically building the collection of a particular library to meet the information needs of the library users (a service population) in a timely and economical manner, using information resources locally held as well as resources from other organizations. 

A library's collection development team collaborates with library staff to manage collection budgets and recommend new titles to acquire. They may review reporting regarding national and local trends in order to do so.

<h1 class="sr-only">Show Appreciative Curiosity</h1>
It's wise to practice expressing appreciative curiosity. Civility rarely goes viral. 

Expressing curiosity gently and calmly can de-escalate a conversation as it disarms anger and allows both parties to retain control. It honors First Amendment and professional values.

However, this is not always as easy as it seems. It takes time, often out of a busy day. It is a skill that requires practice.

A 2025 report by Library Futures entitled <a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/publications/neo-censorship-in-u-s-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neo-Censorship in U.S. Libraries: An Investigation Into Digital Content Suppression</a>, demonstrates that many challenges against so-called "inappropriate" or "pornographic" materials within libraries are "purposeful acts of disinformation presented with false narratives about the source, context, or character of the information." 

The report also details how these claims can be harmful to minors, given that they are frequently "based on discriminatory ideologies that can negatively impact children’s learning, civil rights, and wellbeing."
